Microorganism Detection in Water
Background
In the aqueous tapestry that sustains life, the role of environmental microorganisms (EMs) in water takes center stage, especially when it comes to the paramount concern of public health. Every drop of water tells a story, and within it, microscopic actors play a crucial part.

Dataset
The overall dataset is made up of the following two datasets:

Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Seventh Version is a microscopic image data set containing 41 types of EMs, with 2,65 images and 13,216 labeled objects in XML Format.
Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Sixth Version is a microscopic image data set containing 21 types of EMs. Each type of EM contains 40 original and 40 GT images, in total 1680 EM ages.
Box annotations were generated using the Roboflow tool, generating XML and YoloV8 files.
